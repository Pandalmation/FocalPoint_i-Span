# About Us + App description:
We are first year university students who have a hard time focusing and enjoys procrastination at it's finest. We believe that many of us are struggling through the same problems and thus, we decided to create an online application programmed to help users improve their ability to concentrate through the unique features we provide!

# Features:
- Competitively trains users' focus through a variety of fun brain games

- Provides daily missions for users to complete with the aim of helping users form healthy day-to-day habits. Users can select from which categories they want to get their missions from.

- Mission categories include: Relax, Study, Fitness, Diet, Art, All. For instance, if the user selects the "Relax" category, an example of a mission would be:
"Go out for a 5 minute walk outside". For this mission to be marked achieved, the user needs to enable camera access and his/her location for the activity to be tracked by the app. First, user needs to capture the scenery outside and our application will detect that the user has successfully stepped out of their home. As to measure the "5 minute walk", our app tracks it as a 400m walking distance. This method will ensure that missions are completed fair and square.

- Users earn points from playing games and completing daily missions. These points are called "Focal Points" and can be accumulated and exchanged for a wide variety of online gift cards.

- Users can track, view and compare their progress & results with others. The application can provide insights and solution based on recent progress. For instance, if performance have been going down as a trend or way below your average results (after a week of playing), the application will state so. The application will then give a generated piece of advice "perhaps you needed to drink a glass of water?" "have you been getting enough sleep?" which may help the user think twice to why he/her performance have decreased.

- Provides a survey for users to complete, used to help identify specific concentration weaknesses to work on. This way, the application helps users to set up a goal and in a way, provides motivation for users to continue the use of the app. These concentration issues include: memory problems, multitasking issues or lacking energy to concentrate. Our application will then set missions/games according to users' needs, only if users choose to take the recommended pathway.

# Target Users:
- Users with ADHD
- Chronic Multitaskers
